Experience in software development as well as maintaining infrastructure and understanding the challenges of operating a solution change the way we work and think outside the box. We are focused on delivering the cloud experience in every component we build and with the tools we internally use. Standing on the shoulder of giants is one of the key factors of cloud deployments being fast, reliable, secure, and easy to operate.
